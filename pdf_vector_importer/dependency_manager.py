    * The old code rmtree'd the bundle BEFORE the pip call, so an offline
      machine ended up with no PyMuPDF at all. Renaming instead keeps the
      known-good tree until the install actually succeeds.
    * A pre-existing ``.quarantine`` directory was rmtree'd on entry. After a
      failed restore that stale directory is the ONLY surviving copy, so
      deleting it turned a recoverable orphan into permanent loss. The
      quarantine name is now unique per run and we never touch one we did not
      create.
    * A failed rename used to be swallowed with "let pip --upgrade overwrite
      what it can". That reasoning is wrong: ``pip install --target --upgrade``
      rmtree's the destination directory before installing, so pip is precisely
      the thing that destroys an unsecured bundle. Failures are now reported so
